{: style="text-align: center"}

I developed Covid Clicker for a school project, specifically the Mosaics 8th Grade Seminar. I figured it was fitting that I base it on Covid-19 since I am developing this while in quarantine.

The Release/Stable Version can be found [Here](http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=http://raw.githubusercontent.com/KethTheMeifwa/CovidClicker/master/release/code/maincode.txt) **WARNING:** This currently has no playability, the first version of the game is still in development and can be played from the Beta Link.

The Beta Version can be found [Here](http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=http://raw.githubusercontent.com/KethTheMeifwa/CovidClicker/master/beta/code/maincode.txt) **WARNING:** This version may be unstable and you may frequently lose progress!
