        <h2>Future Plans</h2>

        <p>Let's discuss my plans for this website.</p>
        <p>Starting off, this is obviously a template (which can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp" target="_new">here</a>). Eventually I'll make my own website layout, but for the time being this works. I'm not a huge fan of the white and gray color scheme though so I'll be changing that fairly soon. As for the page content, that template only had a home page layout so I'll be working to change the format of the Projects, Skills, Blog, and Contact pages as I add content to them. I don't plan on actively blogging, so blog will most likely be an archive of these news updates as opposed to an actual blog, still thinking about changing the page name. In other news, I did change my username from KethTheMeifwa to AtomicKeith, and therefor the site address too. To clarify, I go by Keith, my full username is Atomic_Keith (on most platforms) but GitHub wasn't a fan of the underscore. I feel like this is already a long update so to end it off, I'm going to be fully-creating the pages in this order: Contact, Home, Skills, Projects, Blog.</p>

        <h2>Site Makeover</h2>

        <p>Been to my site before? You're probably a little surprised.</p>
        <p>I've recently started doing Freelancing work and I need a site to host my skills and contact information. Given that I have the skills to make my own, but not the money to host my own, I decided to revamp my old, crusty GitHub page.</p>
