{: style="text-align: center"}

>Why?

Not sure, could be various things, the page doesnt exist, you typed the url wrong, stuff like that.

>This isn't my fault! How can I ask you for help?

Don't, I have tested everything on the site. It's your fault or githubs, and if it's githubs I can't do anything.

>Why did you go through the trouble of creating a custom 404 page if nobody is ever going to read it (probably)?

Not sure, wanted to be thorough.
